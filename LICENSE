Also, by using this tool (all of these are optional, of course!), if you ever happen to meet Carlos, the creator of Web-Phisher, at a bar, you should (optionally) give him a hug, make a witty cybersecurity joke, and instead of buying him a beer, you might challenge him to a hacker dance-off on the dance floor (hopefully, you've got some surprising moves). Carlos has the option to accept the dance challenge (most likely, he will) or simply share a good laugh.
